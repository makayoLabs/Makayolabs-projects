To enhance your Media Toolkit, we can expand the functionality to include converting audio to text and video to images, in addition to the previously outlined features. Hereâ€™s how these functionalities can be integrated into the workflow:

### Expanded Functionality Overview


### Updated Application Workflow

#### 1. User Interface (UI) Initialization
- Launch with options to upload files or enter URLs.

#### 2. File Upload/URL Input
- Users can select files or enter URLs for media processing.

#### 3. Media Type Detection
- Determine the media type (audio, video) upon upload.

#### 4. Process Selection
- Based on the media type, present relevant options:
  - **Conversion**: Dropdown for output formats (audio/video/images/text).
1. **Audio to Text Transcription**
   - Users can select an audio file (e.g., MP3, WAV) and choose to transcribe it to text.
   - Options for transcription can include:
     - **Output formats**: Choose between plain text, SRT (for subtitles), or caption files.
     - **Language settings**: Specify the language of the audio for accurate transcription.

2. **Video to Images Extraction**
   - Users can upload a video file (e.g., MP4, AVI) and choose to extract images.
   - Options can include:
     - **Frame extraction settings**: Users can specify the frame rate (e.g., one image per second) or choose specific timestamps.
     - **Output format for images**: Users can select the format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) for the extracted images.

  - **Transcription**: Checkbox for transcription output types (plain text, SRT, captions).
  - **Upload/Save**: Options for Google Drive, email links, or local save.
  - **Audio to Text**: Choose audio files and output formats.
  - **Video to Images**: Choose video files and specify image extraction settings.

#### 5. Additional Options Based on User Selection
- Provide detailed settings based on user choices for conversion, transcription, image extraction, and upload/save methods.

#### 6. Processing
- Execute chosen processes with progress updates.
  - **Conversion**: Handle multi-media conversions.
  - **Transcription**: Use a library (like `SpeechRecognition` or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) for audio transcription.
  - **Image Extraction**: Use a library (like OpenCV) to extract images from videos.

#### 7. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement error handling for processing issues and log actions.

#### 8. Completion and User Notification
- Notify users of successful completion and provide further action options.

### Implementation Tips

- **Audio to Text**: Use the `SpeechRecognition` library or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for accurate audio transcription.
- **Video to Images**: Utilize OpenCV to handle video processing and image extraction.
- **File Handling**: Ensure that output paths are validated and user-friendly, accommodating user preferences for saving files.

This expanded workflow ensures your Media Toolkit can handle a wide range of media processing tasks, making it versatile and user-friendly. Would you like to proceed with this implementation, or do you have any specific requirements for these new features?
