To run the provided script on your Windows system, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If it's already installed, ensure the `python` command is available in the Command Prompt.
- **FFmpeg**: You have already set up FFmpeg correctly on your system. If not, double-check that it is accessible from the command line by running `ffmpeg -version`.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages

Open a Command Prompt and install the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ffmpeg-python tkinter
```

### 3. Set Up the Folder Structure

Make sure the folder structure provided is created on your `F:` drive. You can create it manually or use a script to set it up.

### 4. Save the Script

- Copy the script provided earlier and save it as `convert_media.py` in the `F:\media_toolkit\scripts` directory.

### 5. Running the Script

To run the script, open a Command Prompt and navigate to the script's location:

```bash
cd F:\media_toolkit\scripts
```

Then, run the script with:

```bash
python convert_media.py
```

### 6. Using the GUI

Once the script is running, a graphical user interface will appear:
- Use the "Browse" buttons to select the input and output directories. The defaults are set to the `F:\media_toolkit\input_files` and `F:\media_toolkit\output_files` directories.
- Click "Start Batch Conversion" to begin processing the files.

The script will log conversion results in the `F:\media_toolkit\logs\conversion` directory, and the converted files will be saved in the appropriate folders under `F:\media_toolkit\output_files`.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- If any Python module is missing, install it using `pip install <module_name>`.
- Make sure FFmpeg is properly installed and configured on your system path.

Now, you can expand on this script by adding new features, enhancing the GUI, or automating other tasks like cloud uploading!
