### **Project Overview**
The **OAS Recovery Tax Calculator** is an Excel-based tool designed to help Canadians aged 65 to 70 determine if they will owe the OAS recovery tax (clawback). It also provides strategies to minimize or avoid the clawback by dynamically adjusting key income-related variables like RRSP contributions, pension splitting, or delaying OAS payments. The tool is comprehensive, easy to use, and informative, offering actionable guidance and customizable scenarios.
